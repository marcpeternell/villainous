# Disney Villainous Character Picker

This is a little website to help you deciding your character for your next "Disney Villainous" game. We play it quiet frequently and keep arguing who gets which character to play.

The app is live and hosted on [netlify](http://villainous.netlify.app/) feel free to use it and giving me feedback. If you want to setup localy, follow these steps: 

## Build Setup
```bash
# clone repo
$ git clone git@github.com:marcpeternell/villainous.git

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
